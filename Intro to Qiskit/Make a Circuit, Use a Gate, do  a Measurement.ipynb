    "Qiskit is an opensource Python package created by IBM that provides Quantum Computing simulations as well as the ability to send job requests to real life Quantum Computers. Using this really great tool and simple Python, we can explore the nuts and bolts of QC and how we can use them to really use stuff. Quantum Software is being written now in research groups to try and solve problems using Quantum Computers. The exciting part is that the boundaries of what can be done on a Quantum Computer are far from exhausted and there is alot of mathematics, physics, and computational work left to be explored! To me it always feels like a bold and fresh frontier and it has me absolutely smitten. \n",

    "We are going to go through some examples, I highly encourage for you to try the examples I do on your own, imitation before innovation. I do not expect you to be a coding wiz, but I do want you to be the best in the world at asking questions and being curious and doing your own work. Please ask dumb questions and spam me. \n",
