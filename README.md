# PHYS-31415-Summer-2021

I am Abdulah Amer and will be guiding you thorugh the world of Quantum Computation through the lens of programming.


## Getting Started (PLEASE READ FOR BEGINNERS)

* [Download Python for your appropiate OS](https://www.python.org/ "Python Homepage") Make sure when given the option, to add Python to your path. 
* Use Command Line to install Jupyter notebook (feel free to try Jupyter lab, they should be functionally the same).

* Use Command Line to install Qiskit

* Make sure to restart your computer to put these changes into effect. 

## Make your first Notebook 

* Use Command Line again to open your own Jupyter Notebook, use command "jupyter notebook" and hit enter.

* If done well, your command line should spit out alot of stuff that should not mean a whole lot to you, it will however prompt your default browser to open up a page like this.

* Make a New Folder to hold your Notebooks for this class by clicking the "New" drop down in the right hand corner of the page, and choosing  the "Folder" option.

* You are now ready to use Jupyter Notebook! Label your work and keep everything Organized, it helps in the long run. 

* Click the Untitled in the top of your new notebook to title this notebook whatever you like! You can now move on to learning some Python and Qiskit!
